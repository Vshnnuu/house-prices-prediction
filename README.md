# House Prices Prediction (Kaggle Project)

This project predicts house sale prices using data from Kaggle’s *House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques* challenge.

### 🔍 What I did
- Cleaned and engineered domain-specific features (e.g., total square footage, age, quality scores).
- Trained and blended Ridge, Lasso, XGBoost, and LightGBM models.
- Achieved **~12% relative error** on validation.
- Currently improving feature engineering to **push error below 12%**.
